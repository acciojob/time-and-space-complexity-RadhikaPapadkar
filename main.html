    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to ensure faster execution.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute, including the space needed for input, temporary variables, and recursion stack. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where n is the size of the input.
